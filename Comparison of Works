The main point of our app is its simplicity.
Compared to other habit-tracking apps on the market such as Habitshare, Habitica, and StickK, our app is designed to help cultivate
new habits individually or with friends and family while providing a reward system to motivate users to hit the 60 days mark. 
Habitica is an RPG video game-inspired app that treats its real life like a game. 
To motivate users, one’s customized avatar levels up when a task is completed. One can also unlock in-game features such as battle armor and quests.
Like our app, one can be joined by friends to complete quests and missions. Habitica stores data persistently in a database management system using MongoDB.
The architecture is structured nicely into different layers with a single page application for the client side and backend services accessible through an API. 
Habitshare is a habit tracker that also doubles as a social network. 
It has messaging options that enable you to talk and communicate with people you know. With Habitshare, your individual goals transform into meaningful team efforts. 
However, Habitshare doesn’t feature scheduling tasks monthly. 
StickK is a habit-tracking app that influences behavior change through loss aversion and accountability. 
Users are required to make a commitment contract and set a costly deadline. 
Users bet money on themselves and can assign someone to check the data to ensure that one is on the right track to reaching their goals. 
if they fail in their goals, it costs them money. 
This app has more than 10 communities with like-minded goal setters to interact, offer support, and share best practices.
